| Domain 1 | Foundation Model Integration, Data Management, and Compliance | **31%** |
| Domain 2 | Implementation and Integration | **26%** |
| Domain 3 | AI Safety, Security, and Governance | **20%** |
| Domain 4 | Operational Efficiency and Optimization for GenAI Applications | **12%** |
| Domain 5 | Testing, Validation, and Troubleshooting | **11%** |

{{% notice tip %}}
**Exam Strategy:** Domain 1 (31%) and Domain 2 (26%) account for **57%** of the total score. Prioritize studying these two domains first. Domain 3 (20%) is also critical as it covers security — a topic AWS always emphasizes.
